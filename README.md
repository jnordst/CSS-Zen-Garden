The CSS Zen Garden challenge is a web design challenge that involves creating a visually stunning and creative website design using only CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Participants are provided with the same HTML code but are allowed to modify the CSS code to create their unique design. The challenge aims to showcase the power and flexibility of CSS in creating beautiful and functional web designs. Participants are judged on the creativity, originality, and effectiveness of their design, and the challenge has become a popular platform for web designers to showcase their skills and creativity.
